## General Information
This is assignment on advanced regresion to predict the actual price of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

-  How well those variables describe the price of a house.

### Dataset
A csv file which contains the houses price in Australia market based on some factors.

## Conclusions
- We got good scores for Ridge and Lasso
- Ridge : Train (0.92) and Test (0.88)
- Lasso : Train (0.90) and Test (0.88)
